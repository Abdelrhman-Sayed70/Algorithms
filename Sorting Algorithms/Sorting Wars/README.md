# Sorting Wars 
**Here we will know which sorting algorithm is proper for the problem. So you need to be aware about sorting algorithms and what is flow of each algo**

# Which sorting algo is proper ?

### 1. Sort a file with huge records with tiny keys
- Files are huge so we need to minimize number of swaps (exhange) so the most proper algo is **`Selection Sort`**

---
### 2. Sort huge numebr of records of small size (phone company) 
- **`Quick Sort`** or **`Merge Sort`** 

---
### 3. Sort Database that is almost ordred
- **`Insertion Sort`** Take almost O(n)
---

### 4. Double check on sorted file 
- **`Insertion Sort`** without any changes and O(n) Complexity
