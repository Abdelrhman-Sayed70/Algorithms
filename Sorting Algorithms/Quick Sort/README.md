# Quick Sort

# Approach

### `Divide`
-  Select element (Pivot)
-  Place it in its prober place (move every element smaller than it to its left and all elements larger than it to its right)

### `Conquer`
- Conquer recursively sort 2 subarrays in the same manner 

### `Combine`
- **Trivial**
- At the end each element will be placed in its propper place

# Code
```cpp

```

# Complexity 
- T(n) = T(L) + T(N - L) + O(n)
- Solve using `Recursion Tree` `O(N.Log(N))`

# Advantages


# Disadvantages
