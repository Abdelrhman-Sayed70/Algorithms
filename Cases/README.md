# Cases

## Worst Case 
- situation (input size) leads the algorithm to perform as its worst time.

## Best Case
- situation (input size) leads the algorithm to perform as its best time.

## Average (Expected) Case 
- the expected time of algorithm when it runs over random (unexpected input)
