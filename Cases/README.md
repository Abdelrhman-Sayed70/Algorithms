# Cases

## Worst Case 
- situation (input size) leads the algorithm to perform as its worst time.

## Best Case
- situation (input size) leads the algorithm to perform as its best time.

## Average (Expected) Case 
- the expected time of algorithm when it runs over random (unexpected input) 
- it can contain the best and worst case
- hard to calculate

## Example
`Linear search for item in array`
- Best case : this item found at the index 0 O(1)
- Worst case : this item found at the last index O(N)
- Expected case : any index in the array O(N)
