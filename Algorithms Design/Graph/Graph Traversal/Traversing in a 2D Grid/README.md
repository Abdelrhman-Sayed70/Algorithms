# Traversing in a 2D Grid

- Letâ€™s take the above grid as an example, if you are standing on point (3,2) you can move to the following four points, (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2).
- So, if you are on point (i,j), you can move to (i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1), but first you need to check if the point you are traversing to is in _**borders**_.

# Traversal
