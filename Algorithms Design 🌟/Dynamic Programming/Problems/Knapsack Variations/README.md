## ðŸ’° 0 - 1 Knapsack
- **Each item can be either included in the knapsack or not**
- **We have at most one instance of each item in the knapsack**

## ðŸ’° Bounded Knapsack
- **Each item can be excluded or included in the knapsck from 1 up to n instances not âˆž**

## ðŸ’° Unbounded Knapsack
- **Each item can be excluded or included in the knapsack any number of instancecs âˆž**

## ðŸ’° Fractional Knapsack
- **We can take sub-item**
- **If we take sub-item the value will be reduced also.**
- **For example if we take 1/3 of the item wieght, the value also will be 1/3 of the original value**
- **Solved using Greedy Algorithm**
